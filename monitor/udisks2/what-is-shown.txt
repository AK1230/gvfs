         CONTROLLING WHAT IS SHOWN IN THE USER INTERFACE
         ===============================================

The gvfs-udisks2-volume-monitor process is responsible for the disks,
media, mounts and fstab entries shown in the desktop user
interface. In particular, the Desktop Shell (gnome-shell), the Files
application (nautilus) as well as any other application using the GLib
APIs, is using information from this process.

In general, disks or media with mountable filesystems are shown, as
are fstab entries. These are collectively referred to as "devices" in
the following.

A device is either mounted (in which case its directory is known) or
it's not. If the device is not mounted, then its directory is known
only if it's referenced in the /etc/fstab file. Similarly, the options
for a device is either the options the device is currently mounted
with, or if not mounted, the options from its /etc/fstab entry, if
any.

If the directory for a device is known and outside /media, $HOME
(typically /home/foo) or $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR (typically /run/user/foo)
then the device is not shown in the user interface. Additionally, if
any of component directories in its directory starts with a dot ("."),
the device is not shown either. This policy may be overriden by use of
the options comment=gvfs-show and comment=gvfs-hide.

The name and icon to use for a device is chosen according to certain
heuristics - for example, if a device has a filesystem label, it is
used - if not, some other characteristic is used. The options
comment=gvfs-name=<value> and comment=gvfs-icon=<value> can be used to
override this policy with <value> being an URL-encoded string. For
icons, the Icon Naming Specification is used.

Users are advised to use (stable) symlinks in the /dev/disk/ hierarchy
for /etc/fstab entries instead of the kernel names sda, sdb and so
on. See udev(7) for more information about this.

The Disks application provides an user interface to easily edit
/etc/fstab entries including these options, see

# forcibly show device in user interface and with name "My Movies"
/dev/disk/by-uuid/4CAE8E5B5AF47502   /Movies  auto   defaults,comment=gvfs-show,comment=gvfs-name=My%20Movies

# forcibly show NFS mount in user interface
